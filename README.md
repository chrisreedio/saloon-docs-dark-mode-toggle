# Automagically Set Saloon Docs to Dark Mode

This is repo is a grease monkey script to automatically set the Saloon docs to dark mode when the page loads.

I was going to submit a PR to the Saloon docs to set the default theme to the system theme but it appears GitBook doesn't support that.

Thus, this script was born.
